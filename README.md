# TeeParty

A unified digital platform bringing the entire golfing experience together in one place.

🏌️ Project Overview
As a golfer, I identified a significant gap in the current digital golf landscape. Players are forced to juggle multiple apps to connect with other golfers, book tee times, read course reviews, and manage their gameplay. This fragmented experience creates unnecessary friction and missed opportunities for community building.

Discover and book tee times
Connect with fellow players
Share and read course reviews
Build meaningful golfing networks
Manage their entire golf experience seamlessly
