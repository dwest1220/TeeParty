# TeeParty

As a golfer, I’ve noticed a major gap in the digital golf experience. Right now, players are forced to juggle multiple apps just to connect with other golfers, book tee times, read course reviews, and manage their play.

This project aims to change that.

My goal is to build a one-stop platform where golfers can do everything in one place — from discovering and booking tee times to connecting with players, sharing reviews, and building a golfing network. This unified approach simplifies the experience and brings the golfing community together in a way that no existing app does today.
