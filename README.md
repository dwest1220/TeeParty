# TeeParty

As a golfer, we are missing an online platform that enables us to do everything in one place. We have to use multiple different apps to engage with other golfers, book tee times, see reviews of golf courses, etc. My goal is to create the one-stop-shop that all golfers could greatly benefit from.
